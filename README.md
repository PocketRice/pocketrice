Mostly tinkering in Blender / Java / web, trying to dabble in shaders/retro Nintendo modding/other nonsense. I'm also making an Ottoman-era cannoneering game and a GBC rom hack, supposedly. Perfectionist procrastinator (mostly the former!). Ardent supporter of you â€” yes, you, ya lovely human being! Go you!
